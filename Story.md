Once upon a time there was a monkey who lived on a mango tree. The tree was near a river. In the river lived a crocodile with his wife.
One day the crocodile saw the monkey enjoying the mangoes. The monkey threw a mango toward the crocodile. The crocodile relished the mango.
And he thanked the monkey for the fruit & they became good friends. The crocodile kept visiting the monkey everyday & the monkey shared the mangoes with him.
One day the monkey gave mangoes for crocodile's wife.
